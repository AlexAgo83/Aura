Escapade
I just received reports of some unauthorized military aggression within our territory. 
It would be a terrible embarrassment if they manage to continue their escapade unhindered any longer. 
I request, no actually I DEMAND, that you leave this station immediately, and squash them in a convincing manner. 
Show the world that we will answer any sort of aggression with an iron fist! 
Show no mercy, intercept <M> <T> ! You have only <TL> left !
