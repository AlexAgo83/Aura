Stop the Thief!
A bold thief just got away. 
He stole documents of critical importance to us - he probably intends to sell them to one of our rivals. 
These documents must be returned to us as soon as possible and I think you're the person for this job. 
We have the approximate location of the dastardly thief and I want you to go there and take care of him. 
Good luck, you have <TL>.
