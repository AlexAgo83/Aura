False accusation
A friend of mine <T>, has been falsely accused of fraud and money laundering. 
He's in dire straits and needs helps fast, as his case is due to appear before court later today. 
I have managed to dig up some evidence that prove my friend's innocence.
Please hurry! You have only <TL> left !
